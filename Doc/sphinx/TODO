# ADDING CONTENT

-   Create a list of Simba Extensions. If the extension has a doc on it's own,
    dont forget to link to it.
-   Write mmlref / article (only for developers of Simba)
-   Write tutorial?
-   Write about Simba Stable/Unstable.

# GENERAL

- Run spellcheck before you commit (make sure you ignore section names
  and the like).
- Remove small/extraneous pages (merge them as a section with another or
  mark that you will add stuff to them).
- Create some conventions. Capitalize Simba whenever it occurs, and pick
  either color or colour (it'd probably be best to use color, as the code
  seems to use it).
- Find stuff to add to this list.
